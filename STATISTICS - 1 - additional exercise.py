# Problem Statement 1:

# The marks awarded for an assignment set for a Year 8 class of 20 students were as follows:
# 6 7 5 7 7 8 7 6 9 7 4 10 6 8 8 9 5 6 4 8

# Mean(x)=(6+7+5+7+7+8+7+6+9+7+4+10+6+8+8+9+5+6+4+8)/20 = 6.85

# sort values = 4,4,5,5,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,9,9,10

# Median = (7+7)/2 = 7

# Mode = 7

# SD =sqrt ((6-6.85)^2+(7-6.85)^2+(5-6.85)^2+(7-6.85)^2+(7-6.85)^2+(8-6.85)^2+(7-6.85)^2+(6-6.85)^2+(9-6.85)^2+(7-6.85)^2+(4-6.85)^2+(10-6.85)^2+(6-6.85)^2+(8-6.85)^2+(8-6.85)^2+(9-6.85)^2+(5-6.85)^2+(6-6.85)^2+(4-6.85)^2+(8-6.85)^2)/19

# SD = sqrt(2.6605263) = 1.631111

# Problem Statement 2:
# 
# The number of calls from motorists per day for roadside service was recorded for a particular month:
# 28, 122, 217, 130, 120, 86, 80, 90, 140, 120, 70, 40, 145, 113, 90, 68, 174, 194, 170, 100, 75, 104, 97, 75,
# 123, 100, 75, 104, 97, 75, 123, 100, 89, 120, 109

# SD = sqrt(2029.14/34)=7.725

# Problem Statement 3: 
# 
# The number of times I go to the gym in weekdays, are given below along with its associated probability:
# x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
# 
# f(x) = 0.09, 0.15, 0.40, 0.25, 0.10, 0.01
# 
# Calculate the mean no. of workouts in a week. Also evaluate the variance involved in it.

# Mean of f(x)=(0.09*0+0.15*1+0.40*2+0.25*3+0.10*4+0.01*5)/(0.09+0.15+0.40+0.25+0.10+0.01) = 2.15

# Variance = 1.2275

# SD = 1.1079

# Additional ques :
#     
# three coins are tossed independently,
# 
# what is the probability of getting first atleast 3heads = 1/8 
# 
# atmost 2heads = 1-1/8 =7/8
# 
# atleast 1 head = 1-1/8 = 7/8
# 
# no tails = 1/8
